Simple, advanced, easy-to-use Tiktok Botter made in python.

## Instructions
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - Preferbly add it to your PATH.

  - You also need to have [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) downloaded and added to the same directory as `Tiktok Botter.py`.
- Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a terminal window that's opened in the same directory as `Tiktok Botter.py` and hit Enter.
